This model simulates carbon and nitrogen dynamics on land interactively, with exchanging variables between the land physics and atmosphere component. LUC impact on biogeochemistry is simulated in this component, based on schemes that are newly designed for CMIP6 exercises.\nMinimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff (MATSIRO6) is a land model that consists of six soil layers, up to three snow layers, and a single canopy layer, and predicts the temperature and amount of water in the canopy, soil and snow. It is basically the same as the previous version of MATSIRO, but a physically-based parameterization of sub-grid snow distribution and a snow-derived wetland with consideration of sub-grid terrain complexity are incorporated."
